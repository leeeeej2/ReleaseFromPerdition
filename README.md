# ReleaseFromPerdition

Release form perdition is a 3D first-person shooter in which players use the shadow features which is a short-range teleport function to fight against different types of enemies and reach final goals. This is created with C++ scripting using Unreal Engine 4.

I worked as an AI programmer an gameplay programmer in this project.

- Features:
    1. Shadow:
    the player can spawn the shadow as a clone of the player. This shadow is created at a certain short distance based on the direction in which the player looks. Also, the player can teleport free from the position of the player to the shadow. The shadow just stands without any motion, but the player can use this function to get through narrow gaps or to attract enemies interest in shadow rather than the player during battle.
    2. Combat:
    Player explore several rooms in search of keys to reach the room with the final target point, fighting various types of enemies.
    -Weapon system
    -Three types of Enemies
